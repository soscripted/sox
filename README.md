### SOX v2.2.1 DEV

Stack Overflow Extras (*SOX*) is a project that stemmed from the [Stack Overflow Optional Features (SOOF)](https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features) project.

The SOX userscript adds a bunch of **optional** features to all sites in the Stack Exchange network. These can be toggled on or off from an easy to use control panel (see screenshot below).

Note: This project has no relation to Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange; it is simply a userscript that enhances the sites!

## Installation & Requirements

1. Install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome or Safari). These are userscript managers that *must* be installed in order for this to work, as the script relies on certain `GM_*` functions in order to save your settings!
2. Install the script. Clicking on 'install' below will make your userscript manager prompt you automatically to install it.

    - Official Version: <kbd>[install](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/raw/v2.2.0/sox.user.js)</kbd>. <kbd>[view source](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/blob/v2.2.0/sox.user.js)</kbd>
    - Development Version: <kbd>[install](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/raw/dev/sox.user.js)</kbd>. <kbd>[view source](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/blob/dev/sox.user.js)</kbd>

3. Go to any site in the Stack Exchange Network (e.g. [Super User](http://superuser.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)). You will automatically be asked to choose and save your settings. A toggle button (gears icon) will be added to your topbar where you can change these later on:
