#SOX

Stack Overflow Extras is a project that stemmed from the [Stack Overflow Optional Features (SOOF)](https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features) project. It has been written by [ᔕᖺᘎᕊ](stackexchange.com/users/4337810/) and [ᴉʞuǝ](stackoverflow.com/users/1454538/) new collaborator, new look and features have been rewritten to be better!

The SOX userscript adds a bunch of **optional** features to all sites in the Stack Exchange network. These can be toggled on or off from an easy to use control panel (see screenshot below).

##Installation & Requirements

1. Install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox), [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome), or [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) for Safari. These are userscript managers that *must* be installed in order for this to work, as the script relies on certain `GM_*` functions in order to save your settings!
2. Install the script. Clicking on 'install' below will make your userscript manager prompt you automatically to install it.
	- Official Version: <kbd>[install]()</kbd>. <kbd>[view source]()</kbd>
    - Development Version: <kbd>[install]()</kbd>. <kbd>[view source]()</kbd>
3. Go to any site in the Stack Exchange Network (eg. [Super User](http://superuser.com/) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)). You will automatically be asked to choose and save your settings. A toggle button (gears icon) will be added to your topbar where you can change these later on:

A full list of all the features is available on the SOX wiki page [here](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/wiki/Features).

##Bugs and Feature Requests

Please post bugs and feature requests as issues on [Github](https://github.com/soscripted/sox), where we can track them easily and push updates quickly. Please **do not** post them as answers on Stack Apps -- they are much harder to manage!
